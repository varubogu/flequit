# Performance Design Document

## 0. UI Responsiveness

- Top priority to prevent user discomfort through smooth operation, determining various requirements accordingly

## 1. Performance Requirements

### 1.1 Response Time Targets

- Local database operations: Within 1 second
- Server response (single task): Within 5 seconds
- Full data synchronization: Within 10 minutes

### 1.2 Concurrent Connections

- Local usage: 1 user, multiple users
- Cloud usage: Unlimited (scalable design)

### 1.3 Data Volume

- Active tasks: Unlimited
- Archived tasks: Unlimited (managed in archive database)

## 2. Database Optimization

### 2.1 Index Strategy

- Task ID
- Project ID
- User ID
- Update timestamp (for synchronization)
- Status (completed/incomplete)

### 2.2 Partition Strategy

- Separation of active/archived data
- Data partitioning by user (in cloud environment)

### 2.3 Query Optimization

- Fetch only necessary columns
- Implement pagination (for list display)
- Utilize composite indexes

## 3. Caching Strategy

### 3.1 Local Cache

- Memory cache for active projects
- Cache frequently accessed master data
- UI component state cache

### 3.2 Offline Support

- Temporary storage in local storage
- Synchronization queue management
- Conflict resolution rules

## 4. Synchronization Process Optimization

### 4.1 Differential Synchronization

- Differential extraction based on update timestamps
- Batch size control (1000 items per batch)
- Priority-based synchronization order

### 4.2 Background Processing

- Asynchronous processing for bulk operations
- Background execution of synchronization processes
- Progress status display

### 4.3 Conflict Management

- Use AutoMerge to avoid conflict and merge complexity

## 5. Resource Optimization

### 5.1 Memory Management

- Prevent memory leaks
- Proper release of unnecessary objects
- Monitor memory usage

### 5.2 Storage Optimization

- Optimize attachments (compression/resizing)
- Regular cleanup processes
- Monitor storage usage

## 6. Monitoring and Analysis

### 6.1 Performance Metrics

- Response time
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Storage usage
- Synchronization processing time

### 6.2 Alert Settings

- Response time threshold exceeded
- Resource usage warnings
- Synchronization error occurrence
- Storage capacity warnings

## 7. Scalability Measures

### 7.1 Horizontal Scaling

- Adopt microservice architecture
- Stateless design
- Load balancing

### 7.2 Vertical Scaling

- Optimize resource usage efficiency
- Performance tuning
- Identify and resolve bottlenecks
