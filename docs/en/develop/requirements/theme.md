# Theme

As part of the customization functionality, themes can be customized.
Themes are managed at the following granularity:

- Official themes
- User-published themes
- User-created themes

## Theme Types

### Official Themes

Official themes are built-in themes integrated directly into the app. (No network connection required)
Light theme, dark theme, and several other themes are designated as official themes.

### User-Published Themes

Users can publish their own created themes.
A theme store is established where users can publish and download themes.
User registration is required for publishing.
Downloading does not require user registration.
However, if logged in, the following additional features are available:

- Search for previously downloaded themes
- Favorite theme registration

### User-Created Themes

Themes created by users.
These operate locally only.
Definition information is stored in the database.
For limited sharing, files can be sent to specific people.
This sharing method requires no network connection.

## Theme Details

Customization is done with CSS.
Publishing is also done with CSS files.
However, JSON should also be considered to enable style reuse. (TODO: Review later)
