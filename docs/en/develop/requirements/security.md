# Security Design Document

## 1. Authentication

- Users are authenticated using email address and password.
- Passwords are hashed and stored in the database.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is implemented to enhance user security.

## 2. Access Control

- Access permissions are set based on user roles.
- Only users with appropriate permissions can access each resource.

## 3. Data Protection

- Sensitive data (e.g., personal information, credit card information) is encrypted and stored.
- SSL/TLS is used to protect communication during data transfer.

## 4. Log Management

- Important system events (login, data changes, etc.) are logged.
- Logs are regularly audited to monitor for signs of unauthorized access.

## 5. Vulnerability Management

- Regular security testing is conducted to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability information for third-party libraries and frameworks is constantly monitored and updated as needed.

## 6. Incident Response

- Procedures for handling security incidents are established.
- When incidents occur, impact is quickly assessed and appropriate measures are taken.

## 7. User Education

- Users are educated on security best practices.
- Awareness of phishing attacks and malware risks is increased.

## 8. Regular Reviews

- Security policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated as needed.
- Capability to respond to new threats and technological advances.
