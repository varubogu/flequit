  - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Mobile environment emulation
- Backend: Jest
- API Testing: SuperTest
- Performance Testing: k6

### 1.3 Test Data Environment

- Local development environment: SQLite
- Test environment: SQLite (for CI environment)
- Staging environment: Same DB as production

## 2. Test Types and Scope

### 2.1 Unit Tests

- Business logic testing
- Database access layer testing
- UI component testing
- Utility function testing

### 2.2 Integration Tests

- API endpoint testing
- Database operation integration testing
- Synchronization process integration testing
- Authentication and authorization flow testing
- Multi-language support functionality (key and translation matching)

### 2.3 E2E Tests

#### Critical Use Cases

- Multi-account operations
  - Simultaneous login with 10 accounts
  - Data synchronization between accounts
  - Conflict resolution during synchronization
- Basic task management functionality
  - Task creation/editing/deletion
  - Project management
  - Tag management
- Offline support
  - Operations while offline
  - Synchronization when coming back online
- Multi-language support
  - Display according to user's OS settings or selected settings
  - Verification that all items are complete without omissions

### 2.4 Performance Tests

- Target values
  - Concurrent connections: 10 accounts
  - Response time
    - Local DB operations: Within 1 second
    - Server response: Within 5 seconds
    - Full synchronization: Within 10 minutes
- Load testing
  - Normal load (5 accounts)
  - Maximum load (10 accounts)
  - Overload (15 accounts)

## 3. Test Data Management

### 3.1 Test Data Sets

- Standard data set (for common usage patterns)
- Large-scale data set (for performance testing)
  - Tasks: 10,000 items
  - Projects: 100 items
  - Tags: 1,000 items

### 3.2 Test Data Generation
