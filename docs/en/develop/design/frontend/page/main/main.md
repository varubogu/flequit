Notes:

## About Side Menu Design and Behavior

- All design is left-aligned (when collapsed, shows icon + title → icon only)
- Side menu displays all items in <SVG icon + name> format
- When collapsed, only icons are displayed
  - Projects can have no icon set. In that case, when collapsed, display first 2-3 characters of project name
- Selected items have background color changed (due date button group, project button group)

### Collapse Button

Displays only icon, toggles side menu collapse/expand on each click

### Search Text Box

Displays task list based on content entered in search text box
Also changes URL in web version
Search conditions based on entered content:

- When search text box content starts with "@", search using that content as keyword
  - When "@" is entered, display input suggestions for due date selection, project names, list names, account names, and further input narrows down suggestions to data that partially matches conditions
  - When "#" is entered, display tag input suggestions, and further input narrows down tag suggestions with prefix matching

#### Due Date Keywords

- Due date keywords are "@期限" (期限 supports both Japanese and English)
- Time is 23:59:59 (end of day) unless specified
  - Tasks past due date: @期限切れ, @deadline
  - Due today: @今日, @本日, @today
  - Due tomorrow: @明日, @翌日, @2日, @tomorrow
  - Due day after tomorrow: @明後日, @3日, @3days
  - Due within 7 days: @今週, @週, @weeks
  - Due within 30 days: @今月, @月, @months
  - Due within 90 days from period start: @今期, @period (※period start date must be set in advance)
  - Due within 365 days: @今年, @years
  - Due within 365 days from fiscal year start: @今年度, @years (※fiscal year start date must be set in advance)
  - Due date keywords can also be entered as "@<number><unit>" (e.g., @10日, @10days, @2か月, @3month, 1Q, @2period, next fiscal year)

#### Non-time Keywords

- Project name keywords are "@proj:<project name>" or "@project:<project name>" (e.g., @proj:プロジェクト1, @project:プロジェクト2)
- List name keywords are "@list:<list name>" (e.g., @list:リスト1, @list:リスト2)
- Task name keywords are "@task:<task name>" (e.g., @task:タスク1, @task:タスク2)
- Note keywords are "@note:<note>" (e.g., @note:ノート1, @note:ノート2)
- SubTask name keywords are "@subtask:<subtask name>"
- SubTask note keywords are "@subtasknote:<subtask note>"
- Account keywords are "@<account name>"

#### Tag Keywords

- When search text box content starts with "#", search using that content as tag
  - Tags are "#<tag name>" (e.g., #タグ1, #タグ2)

#### Other Keywords

- If none of the above apply, search task names, notes, subtask names, subtask notes with partial matching

### Due Date Button Group

Provides text box with placeholder "🔍️検索"
Clicking buttons inputs "@今日", "@明日", "@今週", etc. into search text box based on button conditions
Displays task list filtered by search text box results
※All ignore time units (if "今日" was displayed at 12:00 on 1st, display tasks due until 23:59:59 on 1st)

| Filter | Description | Search Reflection |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Overdue | Tasks past due date | @期限切れ |
| Today | Due today | @今日 |
| Tomorrow | Due today and tomorrow | @明日 |
| 3 Days | Due today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow | @3日 |
| This Week | Due within 7 days | @今週 |
| This Month | Due within 30 days | @今月 |
| This Quarter | Due within 90 days | @今期 |
| This Year | Due within 365 days | @今年 |
| This Fiscal Year | Due within 365 days | @今年度 |
