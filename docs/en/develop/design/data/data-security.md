# Data Security Design Document (Integrated Version)

## Overview

Comprehensive data security design for the Flequit task management application.
Provides advanced defense against data theft and achieves robust security suitable for production use.

## 1. ID Design and Security

### 1.1 Dual ID Design

For security enhancement, account and user information adopt a dual ID structure:

#### Internal ID vs Public ID

| Type | Purpose | Security Level | Usage Scenarios |
|------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Internal ID (id)** | System internal identification | Confidential information | Database primary key, internal processing |
| **Public ID (user_id)** | External reference and sharing | Public information | Project participation, task assignment |

#### Account Structure
```json
{
  "id": "account-internal-uuid",     // Internal ID - absolutely confidential
  "user_id": "user-public-uuid",     // Public ID - for external reference
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "provider": "local"
}
```

#### User Structure
```json
{
  "id": "user-public-uuid",          // Public ID - for external reference (all information is public)
  "username": "username",
  "display_name": "Display Name"
}
```

### 1.2 Security Principles

1. **Internal ID Protection**: Absolutely prohibit leakage outside the system
2. **Public ID Usage**: Use only public IDs for project sharing and invitations
3. **ID Separation**: Clearly separate IDs used for internal processing and external collaboration
4. **Leakage Countermeasures**: Make reverse lookup from public ID difficult even if internal ID is leaked

### 1.3 Implementation Guidelines

#### Development Considerations
- Do not include internal IDs in API responses (Account.id only)
- Record only public IDs in logs (Account.user_id, User.id)
- Do not display internal IDs in error messages
- Handle only public IDs in frontend processing (Account.user_id, User.id)

#### Database Design
- Account reference: Use `Account.user_id` (public ID)
- User reference: Use `User.id` (public ID)
- ID conversion for JOIN queries (internal processing only)
- Index settings: Both Account IDs, single User ID

## 2. Data Structure and File Management

### 2.1 Automerge Document (File) Units

- **Account Information**: One file per account (local-account.am, <account-id>.am)
- **Project Information**: One file per project (<project-id>.am)
  - Contains project to subtask and collaborator information

### 2.2 Data Storage Locations

#### Local Storage

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Flequit`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Flequit`
- **Unix/Linux**:
  1. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/flequit` (when environment variable is set)
  2. `~/.local/share/flequit` (when ~/.local/share exists)
  3. `~/.flequit` (fallback)

#### Folder Structure

```
Flequit/
├── account/
│   ├── local-account.am     # Local account (always one)
│   ├── <account-id1>.am     # Login account
│   └── <account-id2>.am
└── projects/
    ├── <project-id1>.am     # Project files
    ├── <project-id2>.am
    └── <project-id3>.am
```

#### Cloud Storage and Web Server

Both store account information with file paths

- **Cloud Storage**: Set arbitrary folder
- **Web Backend**: Assume object storage like Amazon S3

## 3. Encryption System

### 3.1 Basic Encryption Policy

- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
- **Storage Format**: All automerge documents stored encrypted
- **Runtime**: Decrypt only in RAM for automerge operations
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical key structure for fine-grained access control

### 3.2 Encryption Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[automerge document] -->|AES-256 encryption| B[Encrypted file]
  B -->|Storage| C[Local/Cloud/Web]
  C -->|Read| D[Encrypted file]
  D -->|Decrypt in RAM| E[automerge document]
  E -->|Re-encrypt after operation| B
```

## 4. Access Control System

### 4.1 Basic Policy

1. **Local Access**: Only device owner can access
2. **Project-level Control**: Independent access permission management per project
3. **Invitation System**: Explicit invitation required for key issuance
4. **Immediate Revocation**: Any user can be immediately revoked at any time
5. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only minimum necessary permissions

### 4.2 Permission Hierarchy Structure

```
Local Account (Device Owner)
├── Login Account 1 (Service Account)
│   ├── Project A (Project Owner)
│   │   ├── User 1 (Edit Permission)
│   │   ├── User 2 (Read Permission)
│   │   └── User 3 (Comment Permission)
│   └── Project B
└── Login Account 2
    └── Project C
```

### 4.3 Permission Level Definitions

- **Owner**: Full project control (delete, member management, permission changes)
- **Editor**: Create, edit, delete data
- **Viewer**: Read data only
- **Commenter**: View and post comments only

## 5. Key Management System

### 5.1 Key Hierarchy Structure

1. **Master Key**: Top-level key held by local account
2. **Account Key**: Login account key (encrypted with master key)
3. **Project Key**: Project key (encrypted with account key)
4. **User-specific Key**: Key for each user (project key encrypted with user public key)

### 5.2 Invitation and Key Issuance Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner as Project Owner
    participant System as System
    participant Invitee as Invited User
    participant Storage as Storage

    Owner->>System: Invite user (email, permission level)
    System->>System: Generate invitation token (with expiration)
    System->>Invitee: Invitation notification (email, etc.)
    Invitee->>System: Accept invitation + send public key
    System->>System: Encrypt project key with user public key
    System->>Storage: Save encrypted project key
    System->>Invitee: Access permission granted notification
```

### 5.3 Key Rotation

- **Regular Rotation**: Update project keys every 6 months
- **Security Breach**: Immediately update project keys and redistribute to all users
- **Member Changes**: Update project keys when adding or removing members

## 6. User Revocation System

### 6.1 Immediate Revocation Mechanism

Multi-layered defense system for reliable revocation:

1. **Key List Management**: Manage valid user keys whitelist in project metadata
2. **Timestamp-based**: Record each user's last valid timestamp
3. **Immediate Project Key Update**: Immediately regenerate and redistribute project keys upon revocation

### 6.2 Revocation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner as Project Owner
    participant System as System
    participant RevokedUser as Revoked User
    participant OtherUsers as Other Valid Users
    participant Storage as Storage

    Owner->>System: User revocation instruction
    System->>System: Add user to invalid list
    System->>System: Update project key to new key
    System->>OtherUsers: Distribute new project key
    System->>Storage: Delete revoked user key
    RevokedUser->>System: Attempt data access
    System->>RevokedUser: Access denied (401 Unauthorized)
```

### 6.3 Revocation Levels

- **Temporary Revocation**: Access suspension for specified period only
- **Permanent Revocation**: Complete access right removal
- **Permission Demotion**: Change from edit to view permission
- **Partial Revocation**: Restrict access to specific functions only

### 6.4 Emergency Response

- **Unauthorized Access Detection**: Temporarily revoke all users and require re-authentication
- **Device Loss**: Invalidate local keys for the lost device
- **Resignation/Departure**: Immediately remove from all projects

## 7. Project-level Permission Management

### 7.1 Permission Implementation by Sync Method

#### Local Only

- Device owner holds all permissions
- Depends on OS-level file access control
- Additional encryption implementation for multi-user environments

#### Cloud Storage Sync

- Independent encryption per project directory
- Shared folder invitation = project key sharing
- Integration with storage provider permission management

#### Web Sync

- Server-side fine-grained permission control
- API-level operation permission checks
- Detailed audit log recording

### 7.2 Permission Matrix

| Operation | Owner | Editor | Viewer | Commenter |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Delete Project | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Invite Members | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Remove Members | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Change Permissions | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create/Edit Tasks | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete Tasks | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| View Tasks | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Post Comments | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Attach Files | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Export | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### 7.3 Security Boundaries

1. **Project Boundary**: Complete data separation between projects
2. **User Boundary**: Can only reference projects with access rights
3. **Device Boundary**: No impact on other devices when device is lost
4. **Time Boundary**: New data cannot be accessed with past keys due to revocation processing
