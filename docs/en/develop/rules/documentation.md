# Documentation Editing Rules

## Overview

This document defines rules for editing documentation within the project.

## Basic Policy

For detailed documentation policies, refer to:

- [Documentation Policy](../requirements/documents.md)

## Important Rules

### Multi-language Support

- **Always update both Japanese and English versions of the documents**
- Ensure content consistency between Japanese version (`docs/ja/`) and English version (`docs/en/`)
- Updating only one language version is prohibited

### File Structure

- Japanese version: `docs/ja/develop/requirements/documents.md`
- English version: `docs/en/develop/requirements/documents.md`

## Editing Procedure

1. Edit the Japanese version of the document
2. Edit the English version with corresponding content
3. Verify that both versions are consistent
4. Update other related documents if necessary

## Notes

- When updating documentation, always update both language versions simultaneously
- Edit both files at once to avoid content inconsistencies
- Ensure proper translation quality rather than relying on machine translation
