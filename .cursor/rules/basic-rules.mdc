# Basic Rules

## About Responses

Respond in Japanese

## Permission Confirmation for Modifications

When instructed to make changes, do not immediately modify parts unrelated to the source without first asking for permission from the user.

## Build and Test Limitations

For both bun and cargo, limit the number of workers to 4 during build and full test execution (to prevent unintended load on the user)

- cargo test -j 4 # All cargo commands (check, build, test, clippy, fmt, etc.) should limit workers to 4
- bun run test    # This is already configured in the settings file, so no need to be conscious of it
